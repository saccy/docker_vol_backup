## Bash (mac/linux) and PowerShell (windows) scripts to backup and restore docker volumes to and from local storage

This has come in handy when developing something in a container with persistent storage and having to switch between mac and windows

i.e. finish dev on mac and backup volume > restore volume on windows and restart work 

### TODO:
* better argument names
* better examples
* error handling
* additional storage options
    * s3
    * az blob
* additional storage formats
    * zip
    * tar.gz
* better output (comments, updates, results etc.)
